```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



```{r cars}
library(pander)

library(mosaic)
pander()
x <- KidsFeet %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(aveLength = mean(length), 
             sdLength = sd(length), 
             sampleSize = n())
pander(x)

```

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
